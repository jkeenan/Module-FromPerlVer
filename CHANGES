-   v0.5.0 Tue Mar 13 18:24:57 CDT 2018

    Working version_from handler.

    Kwikhaks to generate version directory for a variety of
    version formats (make-version-dir) and recover the sandbox
    (make-sandbox-dir).

    Generator for dynamic tests based on version dir's (make-tests).

    The t/bin/make-* files are called from Makefile.PL.

-   v0.4.4 Mon Mar 12 10:14:04 CDT 2018

    Fix botched path in usability for extracting the 
    sandbox .git.

-   v0.4.3 Sun Mar 11 14:08:02 CDT 2018

    Added tests, shell script to generate minimal
    sandbox test directory (extracted as necessary
    via 0-usable.t). this needs to be re-run if 
    there are changes to the ./version directory.

    Added shell snippets to acquire usable test list
    into MANIFEST. The trick here is grabbing all of
    ./t other than the stub .git directory and including
    the ./t/sandbox/.git.tar file.

-   v0.4.2 Thu Mar  8 15:53:35 CST 2018

    Modify git tests to be language-agnostic 
    (hack regex rather than try to set the LC to 
    C so that folks can read the test results).

-   v0.4.1 Thu Mar  8 15:00:08 CST 2018

    Cleaned up packaging in the git tests.
    
    Non-URL git tests should now be portable.

    Still figuring out reliable way to test the URL handling
    (e.g., without a network). Any fix I can think of won't
    be portable to Windows due to lack of filesystem sockets.

-   v0.4.0

    Allows defining arguments for tball & url, takes first one
    that works. 

    POD for PREOP in Makefile.PL for auto-generating repo tarball.

    Git still needs testing, especially on Windows.

    Interface shouldn't change much at this point, main issue will
    be making the url-clone approach work and validating all of
    the ways that tarballs can fail.

-   v0.3.1  

    Test cleanups (mainly botched check for existing git executable).

    Start adding extract git from tarball of .git or url.

-   v0.3.0 Wed Mar  7 21:52:37 CST 2018

    POD & tests for Git, enough hacks on the Git module
    that it works with the tests (Caveat Emptor).

    Fix bug of $ENV{ PERL_VERSION } not being parsed and
    numified.

    Minor clenaups.

    Make consistent use of extractor's "value" method
    rater than looking directly into the hash.

    Extract::value rejects false keys (used to be only
    undefined).

    Bump the module versions up a notch to 0.1.0 since
    the tests pass and it all seems to do something 
    at this point.

-   v0.2.0 Tue Mar  6 19:18:15 CST 2018

    POD

    Bump version.

-   v0.1.0 Tue Mar  6 12:38:07 CST 2018

    Passes all Dir tests on all platforms, bump up version.

    POD.

-   v0.0.7 Mon Mar  5 23:06:03 CST 2018

    Correct error in Makefile.PL.

    Added tests.

-   v0.0.6

    POD cleanups.

    Copy message "files" => "files/dirs" to avoid confusion with
    list of files displayed.

-   v0.0.5

    Remove FindBin::libs from Makefile.PL.

-   v0.0.4 Sat Mar  3 22:51:10 CST 2018

    Modify tests, separate require from calling import.

    Report version of module loaded via require to isolate
    which version is not parsable by 5.8.

-   v0.0.3 Fri Mar  2 14:19:47 CST 2018

    Makefile.PL, add missing dependencies.

-   v0.0.2 Thu Mar  1 13:45:34 CST 2018

    Add handling for Git, split low-level functions
    for acquiring data into Dir and Git classes. 

    Utility functions have a few changed names to make
    them consistent with switching between subdir and 
    git tags.

    Git is largely untested.

    Added tests & sanity checks.

-   v0.0.1  Sun Feb 18 14:19:59 CST 2018

    Initial kwikhak... ah... er... "relase", yes,
    that's the word: release.
